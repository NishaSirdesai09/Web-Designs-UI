# React Job Portal

## Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for job seekers, enabling them to explore job listings and company profiles. Developed using React, it incorporates Material UI for styling (optional) and Axios for efficient API communication. The job portal features user authentication, dynamic content rendering, and a user-friendly interface. It's designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements and integration with a Node.js-based backend system.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality using pre-stored usernames and passwords.
- **Dynamic Job Listings**: Users can explore various job listings, each providing details about the job role, required skills, and salary.
- **Company Showcase**: A gallery of company images and names, offering users insights into potential employers.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Material UI components (optional) to ensure a polished and responsive user experience across various devices.

## To begin with :

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd path/to/project
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.

   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Backend Server**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server should now be running and listening for requests.

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and install dependencies.

   ```sh
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the React Development Server**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the job portal in your default web browser.
